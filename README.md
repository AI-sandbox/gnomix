# XGMix: Local-Ancestry Inference With Stacked XGBoost

This repository includes a python implemenation of XGMix, a gradient boosting tree-based local-ancestry inference (ancestry deconvolution) method. 

XGMIX.py can be used in two ways:

- training a model from scratch using provided training data or 
- loading a pre-trained XGMix model (see **Pre-Trained Models** below)

In both cases the models are used to infer local ancestry for provided query data.

## Dependencies
The dependencies are listed in *requirements.txt*. Assuming [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) is already installed, they can be installed via
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
When using the program for training a model, [BCFtools](http://samtools.github.io/bcftools/bcftools.html) must be installed and available in the PATH environment setting.

## Usage

### When Using Pre-Trained Models
XGMIX.py loads and uses pre-trained XGMix models to predict the ancestry for a given *<query_file>* and chromosome number. 

To execute the program with a pre-trained model run:
```
$ python3 XGMIX.py <query_file> <genetic_map_file> <output_basename> <chr_nr> <phase> <path_to_model> 
```

where 
- <*query_file*> is a .vcf or .vcf.gz file containing the query haplotypes which are to be analyzed (see example in the **demo_data/** folder)
- <*genetic_map_file*> is the genetic map file (see example in the **demo_data/** folder)
- <*output_basename*>.msp.tsv and <*output_basename*>.fb.tsv is where the predictions are written (see details in **Output** below and an example in the **demo_data/** folder)
- <*chr_nr*> is the chromosome number
- <*phase*> is either True or False corresponding to the intent of using the predicted ancestry for phasing (see details in **Phasing** below and in the **XGFix/** folder)
- <*path_to_model*> is a path to the model used for predictions (see **Pre-trained Models** below)

### When Training a Model From Scratch
XGMix.py loads data from the *<reference_file>* 

To execute the program when training a model run:
```
$ python3 XGMIX.py <query_file> <genetic_map_file> <output_basename> <chr_nr> <phase> <reference_file> <sample_map_file>
```

where the first 5 arguments are described above in the pre-trained setting and 
- <*reference_file*> is a .vcf or .vcf.gz file containing the reference haplotypes (in any order)
- <*sample_map_file*> is a sample map file matching reference samples to their respective reference populations

The program uses these two files as input to our simulation algorithm (see **pyadmix/**) to create training data for the model.

### Calibration
XGmix output probabilities might not reflect the true confidence / accuracy of the predictions. By setting to True calibration when training a new model, Isotonic Regression is used to match the predicted probabilities to calibrated probabilities. For example, in a calibrated model, predictions with a probability 80% will be correct 80% of the time.

### Advanced Options
More advanced configuration settings can be found in *config.py*. 
They include general settings, simulation settings and model settings. More details are given in the file itself.

## Output

### *<output_basename>*.msp.tsv
The first line is a comment line, that specifies the order and encoding of populations, eg:
#Sub_population order/code: golden_retriever=0 labrador_retriever=1 poodle poodle_small=2

The second line specifies the column names, and every following line marks a genome position.

The first 6 columns specify
- the chromosome
- interval of genetic marker's physical position in basepair units (one column represents the starting point and one the end point)
- interval of genetic position in centiMorgans (one column represents the starting point and one the end point)
- number of *<query_file>* SNP positions that are included in interval

The remaining columns give the predicted reference panel population for the given interval. A genotype has two haplotypes, so the number of predictions for a genotype is 2*(number of genotypes) and therefore the total number of columns in the file is 6 + 2*(number of genotypes)

### *<output_basename>*.fb.tsv
The first line is a comment line, that specifies the order of the populations, eg:
#reference_panel_population:	AFR	EUR	NAT

The second line specifies the column names, and every following line marks a genome position.

The first 4 columns specify
- the chromosome
- mean of genetic marker's physical position in basepair units
- mean of genetic position in centiMorgans
- genetic marker index

The remaining columns represent the query hapotypes and reference panel population and each line markes the estimated probability of the given genome position coming from the population. A genotype has two haplotypes, so the number of predictions for a genotype is 2*(number of genotypes)*(number of reference populations) and therefore the total number of columns in the file is 6 + 2*(number of genotypes)*(number of reference populations).

### Model and simulated data
When training a model, the resulting model will be stored in **./models**. That way it can be re-used for analyzing another dataset.
The model's estimated accuracy is logged along with a confusion matrix which is stored in **./models/analysis**.
The program simulates training data and stores in **./generated_data**. To automatically remove the created data when training is done,
set *rm_simulated_data* to True in *config.py*. Note that in some cases, the simulated data can be re-used for training with similar settings. 
In those cases, not removing the data and then setting *run_simulation* to False will re-use the previously simulated data which can save a lot of time and compuation.

## Pre-Trained Models

Pre-trained models will soon be available for download from [XGMix-models](https://github.com/AI-sandbox/XGMix-models).

When making predictions, the input to the model is an intersection of the pre-trained model SNP positions and the SNP positions from the <query_file>. That means that the set of positions that's only in the original training input is encoded as missing and the set of positions only in the <query_file> is discarded. When the script is executed, it will log the intersection-ratio as the performance will depend on how much of the original positions are missing. When the intersection is low, we recommend using a model trained with high percentage of missing data.

The models are trained on hg build 37 references from the following biogeographic regions: *Subsaharan African (AFR), African Hunter and Gatherer (AHG), East Asian (EAS), European (EUR), Native American (NAT), Oceanian (OCE), South Asian (SAS), and West Asian (WAS)* and labels and predicts them as 0, 1, .., 7 respectively.

## Phasing


![Visualization of the process](XGFix/figures/XGFix.gif)


Accurate phasing of genomic data is crucial for human demographic modeling and identity-by-descent analyses. It has been shown that leveraging information about an individualâ€™s genomic ancestry improves performance of current phasing algorithms. XGFix is a method that uses local Ancestry Inference (LAI) to do exactly that. If you suspect your data might be badly phased (often the case when reference panel is small and/or diverse), we recommend using this option. See the **XGFix/** folder for more details.
